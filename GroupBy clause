Syntax: 
SELECT [column,] group_function(column)... 
FROM table 
[WHERE condition] 
[GROUP BY [CUBE | ROLLUP] [group_by_expression] 
[HAVING having_expression] 
[ORDER BY column];

Note :
 Only grouped columns allowed in the group by clause
 Whenever we are using a group function in the SQL statement, we have to use group by clause.

To display the DEPTNO only one time (output with breaks)

INPUT:
SQL> BREAK ON DEPTNO SKIP 1
SQL> SELECT deptno,job,COUNT(*) FROM emp GROUP BY deptno,job;

OUTPUT:
DEPTNO 		JOB 		COUNT(*)
---------- --------- 	----------
10 		CLERK 		1
		MANAGER 	1
		PRESIDENT 	1
20 		CLERK 		2
		ANALYST 	2
		MANAGER 	1
30 		CLERK 		1
		MANAGER 	1
		SALESMAN 	4

ANALYSIS:
Break is Environment command , which breaks the information on repetitive column and displays them only once.
SKIP 1 used with BREAK to leave one blank line after completion of each
Deptno.

SQL> CLEAR BREAK;
