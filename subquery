Important Points:
-----------------------------
Sub query can not use ORDER BY clause. Because ORDER BY clause must be the last clause of SELECT
BETWEEN â€¦ AND operator can not be used with Sub queries

SELECT empno,ename,sal,mgr FROM emp X WHERE EXISTS(SELECT mgr FROM emp WHERE X.mgr = empno);
INSERT INTO emp1 SELECT * FROM emp ;
UPDATE emp SET sal = (SELECT MAX(sal) FROM emp) WHERE Empno = (SELECT empno FROM emp WHERE sal = (SELECT MIN (sal) FROM emp));
SELECT empno,ename,sal FROM emp WHERE sal <ALL(3000,2000,4000);
SELECT empno,ename,sal FROM emp WHERE sal >ALL(3000,2000,4000);
SELECT empno,ename,sal FROM emp WHERE sal >ALL(SELECT sal FROM emp);
